= Kogito Generator Gradle Plugin

## Kogito
https://kogito.kie.org[Kogito] is the next generation of business automation platform focused on cloud-native development, deployment and execution.

This document describes the gradle plugin for Kogito Generator which is a translation of https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-runtimes/tree/main/kogito-maven-plugin[kogito-maven-plugin].

This gradle plugin offers a declarative DSL via _extensions_ (these are Gradle project extensions).
These map almost fully 1:1 with the options you'd pass to the CLI or Maven plugin.
The plugin maps extensions to tasks, base configuration is specified on `kogito` extension and applied to all tasks, the other extensions
are mapped to a task of the same name to provide a clean API.
If you're interested in the extension/task mapping concept from a high-level, you can https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/custom_plugins.html#sec:mapping_extension_properties_to_task_properties[check out Gradle's docs].

== Tasks

Tasks are listed under the "kogito generator" tasks heading.

.kogito generator Tasks
|===
|task name |description

|*kogitoGenerateModel*
a|
 * Generates code via Kogito Application Generator API for supported kogito specification documents like bpmn, dmn, drl, etc.
 * Generates persistence code via Kogito Persistence Generator API for supported kogito persistence types like jdbc, mongodb, kafka, etc.
 * Compiles kogito generated code.

|*kogitoScaffold*
|Similar to kogitoGenerateModel task but placing generated java classes on project main java source directory.
|===

[NOTE]
====
Kogito generator plugin by default is configured to execute automatically as part of compile task, this behavior can be disabled by `autoBuild` property on `kogito` extension.

== Plugin Setup

[source,group]
----
plugins {
  id "io.github.jmusacchio.kogito.generator" version "10.1.0"
}
----

Using https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:old_plugin_application[legacy plugin application]:

[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenLocal()
    maven { url "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2" }
    // or, via Gradle Plugin Portal:
    // url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "io.github.jmusacchio:kogito-generator-gradle-plugin:10.1.0"
  }
}

apply plugin: 'io.github.jmusacchio.kogito.generator'

== Overwrite kogito templates

On some situations it is valid and useful to tweak generated java source code for instance
when you need to modify the exposed endpoint urls to match your url schema/spec. The problem with that is
that each time the generator runs will overwrite manual changes, so in order to mitigate it one way can be
to overwrite kogito code generator templates.

In order to accomplish that, it can be performed doing the following:

.in build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        //...
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath files ("src/main/resources")
    }
}
----

And placing the template files inside `class-templates` folder.

So a file example location would be `src/main/resources/class-templates/RestResourceSpringTemplate.java` which is going
to overwrite default https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-runtimes/blob/main/kogito-codegen-modules/kogito-codegen-processes/src/main/resources/class-templates/RestResourceSpringTemplate.java[RestResourceSpringTemplate.java]

https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-runtimes/tree/main/kogito-codegen-modules[Here] are the code generator modules.

Also later if a version upgrade is performed to kogito libraries, those templates also should be updated as well whether it changed.

== Examples

=== kogito

Disable automatic build hook up so the task `kogitoGenerateModel` is not run automatically.

.in build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
kogito {
    autoBuild = false
}
----

There are some examples using the kogito gradle plugin in https://github.com/jmusacchio/incubator-kie-kogito-examples[this repository]
which is of a fork of the original https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-examples[incubator-kie-kogito-examples]
